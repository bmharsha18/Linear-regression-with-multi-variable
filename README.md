Linear regression with multi variable

Suppose you are selling your house and you
want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to
first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing
prices.

The file dataset.csv contains a training set of housing prices in Port-
land, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the
second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price
of the house.
